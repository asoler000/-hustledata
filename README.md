```
• Find a company you are interested in and search for that company by stock 
symbol. Your search results will show answers to questions that identify 
specific areas that are important to the understanding of the company. 
    • Each question will come back green or red. Green means yes, red means no.
    • The more green (yes) the less risky the investment is.
• You'll also see articles related to the company you searched for in the News section.
• Scroll down the page and search for Cryptocurrency as well. Search by ticker name.
```
